Greetings. 08.12.2024 - the Self-Service Checkout project is ready for its first release.

The project was written immediately after learning the PyQt6 framework. It also uses a connection to the google api, via .the jonson file, which unfortunately I can't attach.

An example of a table for launching a project is provided by the link - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OiZy-fRYNQSTZMPY0EpY1GxvzWyWsIBABVmLEvETMP0/edit?usp=sharing


Before launching, you need to connect to the Google table, having previously installed the necessary libraries in the virtual environment - pip install -r requirements.txt

I will be glad to have comments and comments!
